This repository has the files to vizualize the dynamic programming memory updates in the edit distance recursive algorithm between two strings. Call the edit distance algorithm as "python editDistanceViz.py". Make sure png_editDistance.py file is in the same directory 
due to the editDistanceViz.py file imports module from png_editDistance.py. You can see GIFs getting created for visualization. Have a hand run of the algorithm with the vizual guidance to better understand the algorithm. See also the article at LinkedIn in the
link below.
